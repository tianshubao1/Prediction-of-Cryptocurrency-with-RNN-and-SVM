# Prediction-of-Cryptocurrency-with-RNN-and-SVM

We used two models (RNN and SVM)to predict three kinds of cryptocurrencies(Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin)in the first week of December 2017 and compared the reliability of the two models. 

Our data was collected from yahoo finance website.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD/history?p=ETH-USD	
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LTC-USD/history?p=LTC-USD

We compose the price of Bitcoin(BTC), Ethereum(ETH) and Litecoin(LTC) in csv format and the file contains information including volumns ,dates, open price, high price and low price.
